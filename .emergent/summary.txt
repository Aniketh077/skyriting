The AI engineer successfully initiated the Skyriting V1 social fashion commerce app, addressing evolving user requirements iteratively. Initial setup involved configuring the Expo/FastAPI/MongoDB stack and resolving persistent MongoDB Atlas SSL connection issues with troubleshooting. Core features like authentication (Email/Password + Google OAuth), Razorpay payment integration, an email system, image uploads (Base64), advanced product filters, and a dynamic swipe-based home feed were implemented. Key frontend fixes included navigation redirects and a product detail page. Recent work focused on creating admin panels for brands and products, and the engineer is now tackling user management, push notifications, share functionality, and responsive UI. The process involved constant testing and adaptation based on user feedback.

<product_requirements>
Skyriting V1 is a cross-platform (Android/Apple) social fashion commerce app. Users swipe to discover outfits, connect with influencers, and shop.
**Admin Panel:** Superadmin/Staff roles manage users (view, approve, ban, verify influencers), brands (CRUD, approval, categories, logos), products (CRUD, categories, price, stock, images/videos, visibility), orders (status, payment, tracking, refunds), and basic analytics.
**User App:** Features onboarding (Splash, Email/Password + Google sign-in, profile setup), a Bumble-like swipe feed (Like/Skip, Wishlist, Product Details), Product Detail Page (images, price, size, color, Add to Cart/Buy Now, Share), Cart & Checkout (manage items, apply coupons, address, Razorpay payment, order confirmation), Profile (orders, wishlist, edit), and Verified Influencer Profiles (tag products, analytics, shop tab). Lightweight social features include Follow/Unfollow, Like/Comment.
**Business Operations:** Admin manually adds brands/products, users browse/buy, influencers promote, orders processed via integrated payment, and admin manages sales/returns.
**Key Integrations/Features:** Razorpay Payment Gateway, Email System (with invoices), Google OAuth, advanced filters (Men, Women, Brands, Size, Category), Brand Stores, Push Notifications, Share option with deep linking, Responsive UI, and Base64 image uploads. The goal is a production-ready, end-to-end functional application.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was working on completing several remaining features for the app to be production-ready. Specifically, the task involved implementing Share Functionality with deep linking and making the UI fully responsive, along with Users Management and Push Notifications. The most recent actions indicate that the engineer is currently focusing on enhancing the share functionality (evidenced by the last edit, Chat 210, which was successful, though the specific file is not explicitly named in the response but contextually implies a frontend file), and the next step is to continue with this implementation. Before this, the engineer had successfully implemented the core home screen with swipe gestures, filters, and navigation to a product detail page (). Additionally, comprehensive admin panels for managing brands () and products (), and a dashboard entry point () were created. The login, register, and profile screens were also recently fixed and confirmed to be working end-to-end with the backend.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the share functionality with deep linking, then proceed to build the Users Management admin panel.
